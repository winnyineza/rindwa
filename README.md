## Overview

Rindwa App is a real-time, citizen-centered platform enabling users to report emergencies, verify incidents through community voting, notify emergency contacts, and connect directly with government agencies like the Rwanda National Police. The app leverages mobile-first design and cloud integration to bridge communication gaps in emergency response.

This document summarizes the **initial version** of the solution, fulfilling the requirements for the FullStack track demonstration.
